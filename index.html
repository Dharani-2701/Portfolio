            <p class="about-content">
              I’m Dharani T, a Computer Science Engineering graduate who
              completed my degree in June 2025. I have hands-on experience in
              web development and software testing through real-time academic
              projects and two internships. During my internships, I worked on
              creating functional web pages, improving user experience,
              preparing test cases, executing test scenarios, and documenting
              bugs using industry tools. These experiences helped me understand
              how software is built, tested, and delivered in real-world
              environments. I enjoy learning new technologies, solving problems,
              and contributing to clean, user-friendly, and reliable
              applications. I am eager to apply my skills in a professional
              environment and continue growing as a Software Developer and QA
              Tester.

                During this internship, I was introduced to the fundamentals of
                web development and gained strong hands-on experience in
                building static web pages. I learned the core concepts of HTML
                and CSS and practiced creating structured layouts, responsive
                designs, and clean user interfaces. This internship helped me
                build a solid base in front-end development and improved my
                understanding of how websites are designed and developed from
                scratch.

                In this internship, I worked on real-time web development tasks
                and strengthened my understanding of JavaScript and React
                fundamentals. I gained practical exposure to JSON Server, API
                handling, component-based UI building, and web application
                structure. During this time, I contributed to developing a
                functional Online Book Store with features such as book listing,
                filters, cart flow, admin panel, and user account pages. This
                experience helped me apply coding concepts in real-world
                scenarios and improve my development workflow.

                After completing my web development internship, I was selected
                for a 3-month QA internship based on my performance. During this
                period, I gained practical knowledge of Software Testing
                concepts, including SDLC, STLC, test planning,test case design,
                defect life cycle, and different testing types. I was assigned
                to the HRMS project, where I performed requirement analysis,
                functional testing, UI validation, and defect reporting. In the
                final phase of my internship, I worked on a live project – Haven
                Deeds as a QA Intern. I prepared test scenarios, executed test
                cases, identified defects, and collaborated with developers to
                verify fixes. This internship enhanced my understanding of
                software quality,documentation standards, and end-to-end testing
                processes.
